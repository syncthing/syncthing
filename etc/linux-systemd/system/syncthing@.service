# SANDBOXING
#############
#
# This section contains best-effort sandboxing of syncthing. Such sandboxing is
# useful to reduce the blast damage of a syncthing exploit.
#
# The sandboxing is "best-effort" only because some of these options are ignored
# if your systemd or kernel are too old or configured in unusual ways. Systemd
# should (but may not) tell you in the journal logs if that's the case. See the
# logs (after starting the service) with:
#
#    journalctl --boot --pager-end --unit syncthing@<user-you-used>.service
#
# See systemd's analysis of syncthing's sandbox with:
#
#    systemd-analyze security syncthing@<user-you-used>.service
#
# Most of these sandboxing options are documented in `man systemd.exec`.
#
# NOTE: Some of these options _appear_ redundant with each other... but
# depending on the version and configs of systemd and the kernel, some of the
# "redundant" options may be non-functional while others still work. So resist
# the urge to be clever and leave the "redundant" options alone.

# Makes /usr, /boot, /efi and /etc read-only.
ProtectSystem=full
# Protect several system areas syncthing should NEVER touch
ProtectKernelTunables=true
ProtectKernelModules=true
ProtectKernelLogs=true
ProtectControlGroups=true
ProtectHostname=true
ProtectClock=true
# No new privileges through SUID/SGID binaries
NoNewPrivileges=true
# Prevents *setting* SUID/SGID bits on files/dirs
RestrictSUIDSGID=true
# Prevent memory pages that are both writable and executable. This kills JIT
# compilers, but syncthing is precompiled.
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
# Prevents creation of unprivileged user namespaces which are a LARGE source of
# privilege escalation exploits.
#
# (In 2023, Google saw 44% of kernel exploits using unpriv. user namespaces.
# Source: https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-23-10-restricted-unprivileged-user-namespaces)
#
# The service can still be placed *inside* such user namespaces (and is, through
# other sandboxing options), it just can't create any itself.
RestrictNamespaces=true
# RT task scheduling can be abused for denial-of-service
RestrictRealtime=true
# NOTE: This option is poorly named. It doesn't _restrict_ the listed families,
# it _allows_ the listed families. Unlisted ones are restricted.
#
# Specifically, notice the absence of AF_UNIX (Unix sockets) and AF_PACKET (raw
# packets). AF_NETLINK is needed because otherwise we see the following error
# on startup, even though everything actually works:
#
#  Failed to list network interfaces (error="route ip+net: netlinkrib:
#  address family not supported by protocol" log.pkg=upnp)
#
# This option does NOT affect sockets passed by systemd through .socket units.
# Exclusively using systemd-provided sockets (together with restricting all
# address families) would be _amazing_ for security, but would require some
# syncthing code and config UX changes.
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_NETLINK
# The lifetime limit of (superuser) capabilities that syncthing can acquire.
# This option _limits_ capabilities.
CapabilityBoundingSet=
# Start with empty (superuser) capabilities. This option _adds_ capabilities.
# AmbientCapabilities should equal CapabilityBoundingSet.
AmbientCapabilities=
# Disables `personality` system call; it can be used for privilege escalation.
LockPersonality=true
# Prevents circumvention of restrictions through the use of x86 syscalls on
# x86-64 systems.
SystemCallArchitectures=native
# Clean up IPC objects after service stops.
RemoveIPC=true
# Create private namespace for System V IPC.
# NOTE: This does _nothing_ for AF_UNIX sockets which are far more commonly
# used.
PrivateIPC=true
# Completely isolated /tmp and /var/tmp
PrivateTmp=disconnected
# New /dev with safe virtual devices like /dev/null
PrivateDevices=true
# Allow access to devices explicitly listed with DeviceAllow and pseudo devices
# like /dev/null.
DevicePolicy=closed
# Creates a new PID namespace. /proc now contains only entries for processes
# in this PID namespace.
PrivatePIDs=true
# Make processes owned by other users hidden in /proc/
ProtectProc=invisible
# Prevent access to non-pid interfaces in /proc.
ProcSubset=pid
# System call allow-list. This is a very basic start. An explicit list of every
# syscall syncthing makes would be *much* better. See docs for the property.
# See SystemCallLog= if building a precise list.
SystemCallFilter=@system-service
# Explicitly disallow @privileged syscalls. Syncthing fails to start if we also
# disallow @resources (which `systemd-analyze` is unhappy about).
# Also disallow io_uring syscalls which are as of 2025 a huge source of kernel
# exploits.
# Blocking io_uring_setup should be enough, but let's go further.
# We do not include io_uring_enter2 because it's just a wrapper for
# io_uring_enter and systemd issues a warning.
SystemCallFilter=~@privileged io_uring_enter io_uring_register io_uring_setup
# Return EPERM when a disallowed syscall is made instead of killing the process.
SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM
# Sets up a new user namespace. Maps the "root" user and group as well as the
# unit's own user and group to themselves and everything else to the "nobody"
# user and group.
# Together with running syncthing as a separate user (e.g. "syncthing"), this
# provides a strong sandbox.
PrivateUsers=true
# Digits from left to right; disallow creation of files with:
# - special security-related bits like setuid/setgid
# - (no restrictions on file owner permissions)
# - group-writable access
# - world-readable access
# NOTE: The default value is 0022. We are only restricting special security bits
# and world-readable access.
# NOTE: Syncthing can still _explicitly_ change file permissions using `chmod`.
UMask=7027
# The default HOME folder for system users on Debian-like systems is
# /nonexistent, which should never exist.
# We prevent syncthing from accessing that folder it if was previously created
# through misconfiguration, or from creating it if it's (correctly) missing.
InaccessiblePaths=-/nonexistent

##################
# OPTIONAL CONFIG
##################
#
# Users that want to tweak this service file should add a systemd drop-in
# file to avoid changing the original file.
#
# Documentation describing drop-in files:
#   https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html
#
# Example drop-in file location (assuming user "syncthing"):
#   /etc/systemd/system/syncthing@syncthing.service.d/override.conf
#
## Elevated permissions to sync ownership (disabled by default),
## see https://docs.syncthing.net/advanced/folder-sync-ownership
## NOTE: Use the same value for *both* of these options.
#AmbientCapabilities=CAP_CHOWN CAP_FOWNER
#CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_CHOWN CAP_FOWNER

#########################
# EXTRA CREDIT FOR USERS
#########################
#
# Users that want to harden their systems further should set the following
# properties. (Also through a systemd drop-in file; see comments above.)
#
## Makes all of / read-only *except*:
## - /dev/, /proc/ and /sys/ (see other Protect* options)
## - ReadWritePaths=
## - StateDirectory=, LogsDirectory= and similar
##
## Can't be enabled by default because we don't know which folders you wish to
## share! The user can enable this *together* with
## ReadWritePaths=/my/shared/dir1 /my/shared/dir2
#ProtectSystem=strict
#
## Makes /home, /root and /run/user *invisible* while allowing BindPaths= and
## BindReadOnlyPaths= to "carve out" access to parts of those dirs.
## (Use 'true' instead of 'tmpfs' if you don't need to carve out anything.)
##
## "Invisible" is *much* better than "just" read-only provided by
## ProtectSystem=strict because it prevents information disclosure of private
## user data in case of service compromise.
#ProtectHome=tmpfs
#
## Disallow execution of all binaries. ExecPaths= below carves out exceptions.
## Can't be enabled by default due to the External File Versioning feature:
##   https://docs.syncthing.net/users/versioning.html#external-file-versioning
## If you do not use that feature, just enable both NoExecPaths and ExecPaths
## below it. If you do use it, you should still use these options; just add
## the paths to the binaries you invoke to ExecPaths so they can be called.
#NoExecPaths=/
## Allow execution of syncthing and system shared libraries.
## NOTE: If you are seeing an error like
## "Failed to execute /some/path/to/syncthing: Permission denied", this is the
## option you need to update to use your non-standard install location.
#ExecPaths=/usr/bin/syncthing /usr/lib
