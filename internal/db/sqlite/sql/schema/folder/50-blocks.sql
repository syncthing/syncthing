-- Block lists
--
-- The block lists are extracted from FileInfos and stored separately. This
-- reduces the database size by reusing the same block list entry for all
-- devices announcing the same file. Doing it for all block lists instead of
-- using a size cutoff simplifies queries. Block lists are garbage collected
-- "manually", not using a trigger as that was too performance impacting.

-- Blocks
--
-- For all local files we store the blocks individually for quick lookup. A
-- given block can exist in multiple blocklists and at multiple offsets in a
-- blocklist.
