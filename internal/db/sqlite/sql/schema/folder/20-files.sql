-- Files
--
-- The files table contains all files announced by any device. Files present
-- on this device are filed under the LocalDeviceID, not the actual current
-- device ID, for simplicity, consistency and portability. One announced
-- version of each file is considered the "global" version - the latest one,
-- that all other devices strive to replicate. This instance gets the Global
-- flag bit set. There may be other identical instances of this file
-- announced by other devices, but only one onstance gets the Global flag;
-- this simplifies accounting. If the current device has the Global version,
-- the LocalDeviceID instance of the file is the one that has the Global
-- bit.
--
-- If the current device does not have that version of the file it gets the
-- Need bit set. Only Global files announced by another device can have the
-- Need bit. This allows for very efficient lookup of files needing handling
-- on this device, which is a common query.
