// performed after release or commit (regardless of whether commit succeeded),
// with one exception -- it's fine to release an already committed or released
// transaction.
//
// A Checkpoint is a potential partial commit of the transaction so far, for
// purposes of saving memory when transactions are in-RAM. Note that
// transactions may be checkpointed *anyway* even if this is not called, due to
// resource constraints, but this gives you a chance to decide when. If, and
// only if, calling Checkpoint will result in a partial commit/flush, the
// CommitHooks passed to Backend.NewWriteTransaction are called before
// committing. If any of those returns an error, committing is aborted and the
// error bubbled.

// The Iterator interface specifies the operations available on iterators
// returned by NewPrefixIterator and NewRangeIterator. The iterator pattern
// is to loop while Next returns true, then check Error after the loop. Next
// will return false when iteration is complete (Error() == nil) or when
// there is an error preventing iteration, which is then returned by
// Error(). For example:
//
//	it, err := db.NewPrefixIterator(nil)
//	if err != nil {
//	    // problem preventing iteration
//	}
//	defer it.Release()
//	for it.Next() {
//	    // ...
//	}
//	if err := it.Error(); err != nil {
//	    // there was a database problem while iterating
//	}
//
// An iterator must be Released when no longer required. The Error method
// can be called either before or after Release with the same results. If an
// iterator was created in a transaction (whether read-only or write) it
// must be released before the transaction is released (or committed).

// them perform quite badly when used repeatedly. For bulk operations,
// consider always using a transaction of the appropriate type. The
// transaction isolation level is "read committed" - there are no dirty
// reads.
// Location returns the path to the database, as given to Open. The returned string
// is empty for a db in memory.
