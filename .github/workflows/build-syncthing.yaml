# A note on actions and third party code... The actions under actions/ (like
# `uses: actions/checkout`) are maintained by GitHub, and we need to trust
# GitHub to maintain their code and infrastructure or we're in deep shit in
# general. The same doesn't necessarily apply to other actions authors, so
# some care needs to be taken when adding steps, especially in the paths
# that lead up to code being packaged and signed.
