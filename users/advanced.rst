Advanced Configuration
======================

Description
-----------

Syncthing has settings that are available but not exposed in the usual folder
and device configuration screens. The reason for not exposing these settings
more prominently varies from them simply being rarely useful, to them being
actively dangerous when used improperly.

.. warning::
   Use care when changing advanced configuration settings and make sure that
   you understand the resulting effects and consequences.
