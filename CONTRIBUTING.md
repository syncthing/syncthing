## Reporting Bugs

Please file bugs in the [GitHub Issue Tracker][issue tracker].  
Include at least the following:

 - What happened.
 
 - What you expected should happen instead of what *did* happen. 
   (Unless it's highly obvious.)

 - The operating system name, operating system version, 
   and version of Syncthing, which you are running.

 - The same for other connected devices, where relevant.

 - Screenshot(s) if the issue concerns something visible in the GUI.

 - Console log entries, where possible and relevant.

If you're not sure whether something is relevant, erring on the side of
too much information will never get you yelled at. :-)
