.SH NAME
syncthing-config \- Syncthing Configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$XDG_STATE_HOME/syncthing
$HOME/.local/state/syncthing
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing
%LOCALAPPDATA%\eSyncthing
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Changed in version 1.27.0: The default location of the configuration and database directory on
Unix\-like systems was changed to \fB$XDG_STATE_HOME/syncthing\fP or
\fB$HOME/.local/state/syncthing\fP\&. Previously the default config location
was \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/syncthing\fP or \fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP\&. The
database directory was previously \fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP or, if the
environment variable was set, \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing\fP\&. Existing
installations may still use these directories instead of the newer
defaults.

.sp
Added in version 1.5.0: Database and config can now be set separately. Previously the database was
always located in the same directory as the config.

.sp
Syncthing uses a single directory to store configuration and crypto keys.
Syncthing also keeps an index database with file metadata which is by
default stored in the same directory, though this can be overridden.
.sp
The location defaults to \fB$XDG_STATE_HOME/syncthing\fP or
\fB$HOME/.local/state/syncthing\fP (Unix\-like), \fB$HOME/Library/Application
Support/Syncthing\fP (Mac), or \fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\eSyncthing\fP (Windows). It can
be changed at runtime using the \fB\-\-config\fP or \fB\-\-home\fP flags or the
corresponding environment variables (\fB$STCONFDIR\fP or \fBSTHOMEDIR\fP). The
following files are located in this directory:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBconfig.xml\fP
The configuration file, in XML format.
.TP
.B \fBcert.pem\fP, \fBkey.pem\fP
The device’s ECDSA public and private key. These form the basis for the
device ID. The key must be kept private.
.TP
.B \fBhttps\-cert.pem\fP, \fBhttps\-key.pem\fP
The certificate and key for HTTPS GUI connections. These may be replaced
with a custom certificate for HTTPS as desired.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The database is by default stored in the same directory as the config, but
the location may be overridden by the \fB\-\-data\fP or \fB\-\-home\fP flags or the
corresponding environment variables (\fB$STDATADIR\fP or \fBSTHOMEDIR\fP).
.sp
The database directory contains the following files, among others:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBindex\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.db\fP
A directory holding the database with metadata and hashes of the files
currently on disk and available from peers.
.TP
.B \fBsyncthing.log\fP
Log output, on some systems.
.TP
.B \fBaudit\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.log\fP
Audit log data, when enabled.
.TP
.B \fBpanic\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.log\fP
Crash log data, when required.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIG FILE FORMAT
.sp
The following shows an example of a default configuration file (IDs will differ):
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The config examples are present for illustration. Do \fBnot\fP copy them
entirely to use as your config. They are likely out\-of\-date and the values
may no longer correspond to the defaults.

One or more \fBfolder\fP elements must be present in the file. Each element
describes one folder. The following attributes may be set on the \fBfolder\fP
element:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B id (mandatory)
The folder ID, which must be unique.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B label
The label of a folder is a human readable and descriptive local name. May
be different on each device, empty, and/or identical to other folder
labels. (optional)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B filesystemType
The internal file system implementation used to access this folder, detailed
in a \fI\%separate chapter\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B path (mandatory)
The path to the directory where the folder is stored on this
device; not sent to other devices.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B type
Controls how the folder is handled by Syncthing. Possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBsendreceive\fP
The folder is in default mode. Sending local and accepting remote changes.
Note that this type was previously called “readwrite” which is deprecated
but still accepted in incoming configs.
.TP
.B \fBsendonly\fP
The folder is in “send only” mode – it will not be modified by
Syncthing on this device.
Note that this type was previously called “readonly” which is deprecated
but still accepted in incoming configs.
.TP
.B \fBreceiveonly\fP
The folder is in “receive only” mode – it will not propagate
changes to other devices.
.TP
.B \fBreceiveencrypted\fP
Must be used on untrusted devices, where the data cannot be decrypted
because no folder password was entered.  See \fI\%Untrusted (Encrypted) Devices\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rescanIntervalS
The rescan interval, in seconds. Can be set to \fB0\fP to disable when external
plugins are used to trigger rescans.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B fsWatcherEnabled
If set to \fBtrue\fP, this detects changes to files in the folder and scans them.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B fsWatcherDelayS
The duration during which changes detected are accumulated, before a scan is
scheduled (only takes effect if \fI\%fsWatcherEnabled\fP is set to \fBtrue\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B fsWatcherTimeoutS
The maximum delay before a scan is triggered when a file is continuously
changing. If unset or zero a default value is calculated based on
\fI\%fsWatcherDelayS\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ignorePerms
If \fBtrue\fP, files originating from this folder will be announced to remote
devices with the “no permission bits” flag.  The remote devices will use
whatever their default permission setting is when creating the files.  The
primary use case is for file systems that do not support permissions, such
as FAT, or environments where changing permissions is impossible.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B autoNormalize
Automatically correct UTF\-8 normalization errors found in file names.  The
mechanism and how to set it up is described in a \fI\%separate chapter\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following child elements may exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
These must have the \fBid\fP attribute and can have an \fBintroducedBy\fP
attribute, identifying the device that introduced us to share this folder
with the given device.  If the original introducer unshares this folder with
this device, our device will follow and unshare the folder (subject to
\fI\%skipIntroductionRemovals\fP being \fBfalse\fP on the introducer device).
.sp
All mentioned devices are those that will be sharing the folder in question.
Each mentioned device must have a separate \fBdevice\fP element later in the file.
It is customary that the local device ID is included in all folders.
Syncthing will currently add this automatically if it is not present in
the configuration file.
.sp
The \fBencryptionPassword\fP sub\-element contains the secret needed to decrypt
this folder’s data on the remote device.  If left empty, the data is plainly
accessible (but still protected by the transport encryption).  The mechanism
and how to set it up is described in a \fI\%separate chapter\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B minDiskFree
The minimum required free space that should be available on the disk this
folder resides.  The folder will be stopped when the value drops below the
threshold.  The element content is interpreted according to the given
\fBunit\fP attribute.  Accepted \fBunit\fP values are \fB%\fP (percent of the disk
/ volume size), \fBkB\fP, \fBMB\fP, \fBGB\fP and \fBTB\fP\&.  Set to zero to disable.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B hashers
The number of copier and hasher routines to use, or \fB0\fP for the
system determined optimums. These are low\-level performance options for
advanced users only; do not change unless requested to or you’ve actually
read and understood the code yourself. :)
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pullerMaxPendingKiB
Controls when we stop sending requests to other devices once we’ve got this
much unserved requests.  The number of pullers is automatically adjusted
based on this desired amount of outstanding request data.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B order
The order in which needed files should be pulled from the cluster.  It has
no effect when the folder type is “send only”.  The possibles values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBrandom\fP (default)
Pull files in random order. This optimizes for balancing resources among
the devices in a cluster.
.TP
.B \fBalphabetic\fP
Pull files ordered by file name alphabetically.
.TP
.B \fBsmallestFirst\fP, \fBlargestFirst\fP
Pull files ordered by file size; smallest and largest first respectively.
.TP
.B \fBoldestFirst\fP, \fBnewestFirst\fP
Pull files ordered by modification time; oldest and newest first
respectively.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that the scanned files are sent in batches and the sorting is applied

be present in the \fBdefaults\fP element:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
Template for a \fBdevice\fP element, with the same internal structure.  Any
fields here will be used for a newly added remote device.  The \fBid\fP

The UI will propose to create new folders at the path given in the \fBpath\fP
attribute (used to be \fBdefaultFolderPath\fP under \fBoptions\fP).  It also
applies to folders automatically accepted from a remote device.
.sp
Even sharing with other remote devices can be done in the template by
including the appropriate \fI\%folder.device\fP element underneath.

.B ignores
Added in version 1.19.0.

.sp
Template for the \fI\%ignore patterns\fP applied to new
folders.  These are copied to the \fB\&.stignore\fP file when a folder is
automatically accepted from a remote device.  The GUI uses them to pre\-fill
the respective field when adding a new folder as well.  In XML, each pattern
line is represented as by a \fB<line>\fP element.
.UNINDENT
.SS Listen Addresses
.sp
The following address types are accepted in sync protocol listen addresses.

.TP
.B TCP IPv4 wildcard and port (\fBtcp4://0.0.0.0:22000\fP, \fBtcp4://:22000\fP)
These are equivalent and will result in Syncthing listening on all
interfaces via IPv4 only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv4 address and port (\fBtcp4://192.0.2.1:22000\fP)
This results in Syncthing listening on the specified address and port, IPv4
only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv6 wildcard and port (\fBtcp6://[::]:22000\fP, \fBtcp6://:22000\fP)
These are equivalent and will result in Syncthing listening on all
interfaces via IPv6 only.
.TP
.B TCP IPv6 address and port (\fBtcp6://[2001:db8::42]:22000\fP)
This results in Syncthing listening on the specified address and port, IPv6
only.
.TP
.B QUIC address and port (e.g. \fBquic://0.0.0.0:22000\fP)
Syntax is the same as for TCP, also \fBquic4\fP and \fBquic6\fP can be used.

.SH SYNCING CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Syncing configuration files between devices (such that multiple devices are
using the same configuration files) can cause issues. This is easy to do
accidentally if you sync your home folder between devices. A common symptom
of syncing configuration files is two devices ending up with the same Device ID.
.sp
If you want to use Syncthing to backup your configuration files, it is recommended
that the files you are backing up are in a \fI\%Send Only Folder\fP to prevent other
devices from overwriting the per device configuration. The folder on the remote
device(s) should not be used as configuration for the remote devices.
.sp
If you’d like to sync your home folder in non\-send only mode, you may add the
folder that stores the configuration files to the \fI\%ignore list\fP\&.
If you’d also like to backup your configuration files, add another folder in
send only mode for just the configuration folder.
