.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing relies on a network of community\-contributed relay servers. Anyone
can run a relay server, and it will automatically join the relay pool and be
available to Syncthing users. The current list of relays can be found at
\X'tty: link https://relays.syncthing.net/'\fI\%https://relays.syncthing.net/\fP\X'tty: link'\&.

.SS Installing
.sp
Go to \X'tty: link https://github.com/syncthing/relaysrv/releases'\fI\%releases\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/syncthing/relaysrv/releases\fP>\X'tty: link' and
download the file appropriate for your operating system. Unpacking it will
yield a binary called \fBstrelaysrv\fP (or \fBstrelaysrv.exe\fP on Windows).
Start this in whatever way you are most comfortable with; double clicking
should work in any graphical environment. At first start, strelaysrv will
generate certificate files and database in the current directory unless
given flags to the contrary. It will also join the default pools of relays,
which means that it is publicly visible and any client can connect to it.
The startup message prints instructions on how to change this.
.sp
The relay server can also be obtained through apt, the Debian/Ubuntu package
manager. Recent releases can be found at syncthing’s
\X'tty: link https://apt.syncthing.net/'\fI\%apt repository\fP <\fBhttps://apt.syncthing.net/\fP>\X'tty: link'\&. The name of the package is
syncthing\-relaysrv.
.SH SETTING UP
.sp
Primarily, you need to decide on a directory to store the TLS key and
certificate and a listen port. The default listen port of 22067 works, but for
optimal compatibility a well known port for encrypted traffic such as 443 is
recommended. This may require additional setup to work without running
as root or a privileged user, see \fI\%Running on port 443 as an unprivileged user\fP
below. In principle something similar to this should work on a Linux/Unix
system:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$ sudo useradd strelaysrv
$ sudo mkdir /etc/strelaysrv
$ sudo chown strelaysrv /etc/strelaysrv
$ sudo \-u strelaysrv /usr/local/bin/strelaysrv \-keys /etc/strelaysrv
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This creates a user \fBstrelaysrv\fP and a directory \fB/etc/strelaysrv\fP to store
the keys. The keys are generated on first startup. The relay will join the
global relay pool, unless a \fB\-pools=\(dq\(dq\fP argument is given.
.sp
To make the relay server start automatically at boot, use the recommended
procedure for your operating system.
.SS Client configuration
.sp
Syncthing can be configured to use specific relay servers (exclusively of the public pool) by adding the required servers to the Sync Protocol Listen Address field, under Actions and Settings. The format is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
relay://<host name|IP>[:port]/?id=<relay device ID>
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
relay://private\-relay\-1.example.com:443/?id=ITZRNXE\-YNROGBZ\-HXTH5P7\-VK5NYE5\-QHRQGE2\-7JQ6VNJ\-KZUEDIU\-5PPR5AM
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The relay’s device ID is output on start\-up.
.SS Running on port 443 as an unprivileged user
.sp
It is recommended that you run the relay on port 443 (or another port which is
commonly allowed through corporate firewalls), in order to maximise the chances
that people are able to connect. However, binding to ports below 1024 requires
root privileges, and running a relay as root is not recommended. Thankfully
there are a couple of approaches available to you.
.sp
One option is to run the relay on port 22067, and use an \fBiptables\fP rule
to forward traffic from port 443 to port 22067, for example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
iptables \-t nat \-A PREROUTING \-p tcp \-\-dport 443 \-j REDIRECT \-\-to\-port 22067
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or, if you’re using \fBufw\fP, add the following to \fB/etc/ufw/before.rules\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]

\-A PREROUTING \-p tcp \-\-dport 443 \-j REDIRECT \-\-to\-port 22067

COMMIT
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You will need to start \fBstrelaysrv\fP with \fB\-ext\-address \(dq:443\(dq\fP\&. This tells
\fBstrelaysrv\fP that it can be contacted on port 443, even though it is listening
on port 22067. You will also need to let both port 443 and 22067 through your
firewall.
.sp
Another option is \X'tty: link https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NonRootPortBinding'\fI\%described here\fP <\fBhttps://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NonRootPortBinding\fP>\X'tty: link',
although your mileage may vary.
.SH FIREWALL CONSIDERATIONS
.sp
The relay server listens on two ports by default.  One for data connections and the other
for providing public statistics at \X'tty: link https://relays.syncthing.net/'\fI\%https://relays.syncthing.net/\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  The firewall, such as
\fBiptables\fP, must permit incoming TCP connections to the following ports:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Data port:  \fB22067/tcp\fP overridden with \fB\-listen\fP and advertised with \fB\-ext\-address\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Status port: \fB22070/tcp\fP overridden with \fB\-status\-srv\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Runtime \fBiptables\fP rules to allow access to the default ports:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
iptables \-I INPUT \-p tcp \-\-dport 22067 \-j ACCEPT
iptables \-I INPUT \-p tcp \-\-dport 22070 \-j ACCEPT
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Please consult Linux distribution documentation to persist firewall rules.
.SH ACCESS CONTROL FOR PRIVATE RELAYS
.sp
Added in version 1.22.1.

.sp
Private relays can be configured to only accept connections from peers in possession of a shared secret.
To configure this use the \fB\-token\fP option:
.sp
$ strelaysrv \-token=mySecretToken
.sp
Then configure your Syncthing devices to send the token when joining the relay:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
relay://<host name|IP>[:port]/?id=<relay device ID>&token=mySecretToken
