.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing lets you synchronize your files bidirectionally across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.
.sp
The \fBsyncthing\fP core application is a command\-line program which usually runs
in the background and handles the synchronization. It provides a built\-in, HTML
and JavaScript based user interface to be controlled from a web browser. This
frontend communicates with the core application through some HTTP APIs, which
other apps like graphical system integration helpers can use as well, for
greatest flexibility. A link to reach the GUI and API is printed among the first
few log messages.

Set common configuration and data directory. The default configuration
directory is \fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP (Unix\-like),
\fB$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing\fP (Mac) and
\fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\eSyncthing\fP (Windows).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

Set destination filename for logging (use \fB"\-"\fP for stdout, which is the
default option).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

Exit codes over 125 are usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default
signal handler. Exit codes over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which
caused the process to exit. For example, \fB128 + 9 (SIGKILL) = 137\fP\&.
.SH PROXIES
.sp
Syncthing can use a SOCKS, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy to talk to the outside
world. The proxy is used for outgoing connections only \- it is not possible
to accept incoming connections through the proxy. The proxy is configured
through the environment variable \fBall_proxy\fP\&. Somewhat unusually, this
variable must be named in lower case \- it is not “ALL_PROXY”. For
example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ export all_proxy=socks://192.0.2.42:8081

.SH DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS
.sp
The following environment variables modify Syncthing’s behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.
If you start Syncthing from within service managers like systemd or supervisor,
path expansion may not be supported.
