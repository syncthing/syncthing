.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing lets you synchronize your files bidirectionally across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.
.sp
The \fBsyncthing\fP core application is a command\-line program which usually runs
in the background and handles the synchronization. It provides a built\-in, HTML
and JavaScript based user interface to be controlled from a web browser. This
frontend communicates with the core application through some HTTP APIs, which
other apps like graphical system integration helpers can use as well, for
greatest flexibility. A link to reach the GUI and API is printed among the first
few log messages.

.SH GENERATE OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-gui\-password=<password|\->
Specify new GUI authentication password, to update the config file.  Read
from the standard input stream if only a single dash (\fB\-\fP) is given.  A
plaintext password is hashed before writing to the config file, but an
already bcrypt\-hashed input is stored verbatim.  As a special case, giving
the existing password hash as password will leave it untouched.

Exit codes over 125 are usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default
signal handler. Exit codes over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which
caused the process to exit. For example, \fB128 + 9 (SIGKILL) = 137\fP\&.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
The command line syntax supports different modes of operation through
several subcommands, specified as the first argument.  If omitted, the
default \fBserve\fP is assumed.
.sp
The initial setup of a device ID and default configuration can be called
explicitly with the \fBgenerate\fP subcommand.  It can also update the configured
GUI authentication credentials, without going through the REST API.  An existing
device certificate is left untouched.  If the configuration file already exists,
it is validated and updated to the latest configuration schema, including adding
default values for any new options.
.sp
The \fBdecrypt\fP subcommand is used in conjunction with untrusted (encrypted)
devices, see the relevant section on \fI\%decryption\fP for
details.  It does not depend on Syncthing to be running, but works on offline
data.
.sp
To work with the REST API for debugging or automating things in Syncthing, the
\fBcli\fP subcommand provides easy access to individual features.  It basically
saves the hassle of handling HTTP connections and API authentication.
.sp
The available subcommands are grouped into several nested hierarchies and some
parts dynamically generated from the running Syncthing instance.  On every
level, the \fB\-\-help\fP option lists the available properties, actions and
commands for the user to discover interactively.  The top\-level groups are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B config
Access the live configuration in a running instance over the REST API to
retrieve (get) or update (set) values in a fine\-grained way.  The hierarchy
is based on the same structure as used in the JSON / XML representations.
.TP
.B show
Show system properties and status of a running instance.  The output is
passed on directly from the REST API response and therefore requires parsing
JSON format.
.TP
.B operations
Control the overall program operation such as restarting or handling
upgrades, as well as triggering some actions on a per\-folder basis.  Can
also configure the default ignore patterns from a plain text ignore file.
.TP
.B errors
Examine pending error conditions that need attention from the user, or
acknowledge (clear) them.
.TP
.B debug
Various tools to aid in diagnosing problems or collection information for
bug reports.  Some of these commands access the database directly and can
therefore only work when Syncthing is not running.
.TP
.B \fB\-\fP (a single dash)
Reads subsequent commands from the standard input stream, without needing to
call the \fBsyncthing cli\fP command over and over.  Exits on any invalid
command or when EOF (end\-of\-file) is received.
.UNINDENT
.SH PROXIES
.sp
Syncthing can use a SOCKS, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy to talk to the outside
world. The proxy is used for outgoing connections only \- it is not possible
to accept incoming connections through the proxy. The proxy is configured
through the environment variable \fBall_proxy\fP\&. Somewhat unusually, this
variable must be named in lower case \- it is not “ALL_PROXY”. For
example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$ export all_proxy=socks://192.0.2.42:8081
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS
.sp
The following environment variables modify Syncthing’s behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.
If you start Syncthing from within service managers like systemd or supervisor,
path expansion may not be supported.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B STTRACE
Used to increase the debugging verbosity in specific facilities,
generally mapping to a Go package. Enter a comma\-separated string of
facilities to trace: \fBapi,beacon\fP\&. Optionally, a log level can be
given per facility to specify something other than DEBUG:
\fBapi:WARN,beacon:ERR\fP, potentially overriding a global \fB\-\-log\-level\fP
adjustment.
.sp
The valid facility strings are listed below; additionally, \fBsyncthing
serve \-\-help\fP always outputs the most up\-to\-date list.

cores.

(i.e. performance).
